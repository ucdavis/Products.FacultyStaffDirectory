        Description
        ===========
        
        FacultyStaffDirectory is a personnel directory, a provider of shared workspaces
        for committees, a way of keeping track of people's areas of expertise, a floor
        wax, and a dessert topping. It integrates with Plone's users and groups
        infrastructure and supports an extensibility framework for custom requirements.
        
        
        Dependencies
        ============
            
        FacultyStaffDirectory depends on Products.membrane and Products.Relations
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        FacultyStaffDirectory 3 requires Plone 4.0 or greater.
        
        1.  Add the following to buildout.cfg
        
        ::
        
            [buildout]
            eggs =
            . . .(other eggs). . .
                Products.FacultyStaffDirectory
        
        2.  Re-run buildout (typically 'bin/buildout').
        
        3.  Restart Zope (typically 'bin/instance restart').
        
        4.  Install the FacultyStaffDirectory product using
            portal_quickinstaller or the Plone Add/Remove Products tool
            under Site Setup. The necessary dependencies will install
            themselves automatically. (Membrane remains in the 'available'
            column, but is in fact installed.)
        
        
        Upgrading
        =========
        
        From FacultyStaffDirectory 1.x
        ------------------------------
        
        To upgrade from 1.x, first upgrade to a 2.x release thusly:
        
        Use the migration script in the Extensions folder of
        FacultyStaffDirectory. Follow the instructions inside
        migrate1dot0to2dot0.py. To perform the migration under Plone
        3, you'll need the `contentmigration product`_.
        
        .. _contentmigration product: 
           http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Products.contentmigration
        
        From FacultyStaffDirectory 2.x
        ------------------------------
        
        To upgrade from 2.x to 3.0 use the "Upgrade" button on the 'Add-on Products'
        page. (in Plone 4.0, this is called "Add-Ons").
        
        **Be sure** to check the workflow and publication state of your Faculty/Staff
        directory. It has probably been changed to 'private'.
        
        If your Faculty/Staff directory was using a custom workflow, it is now in a new
        workflow which comes with FacultyStaffDirectory 3.0. You'll need to change your
        custom workflow to manage the "FacultyStaffDirectory: Provides Roles" permission
        before you go back to it. Check out the 'fsd_directory_workflow' to see how it's
        done.
        
        Special Note for users upgrading to Plone 4:
        --------------------------------------------
        
        Because FacultyStaffDirectory 2.x is not compatible with Plone 4, you must first
        upgrade FacultyStaffDirectory to version 3 then upgrade Plone.
        
        
        
        Using FacultyStaffDirectory
        ===========================
        
        Adding a Faculty/Staff Directory
        --------------------------------
        
        From the "add" dropdown menu in Plone, select "Faculty/Staff Directory". A
        Faculty/Staff Directory will be created as well as several default items inside:
        
        * Faculty (a Classification)
        
        * Staff (a Classification)
        
        * Graduate Students (a Classification)
        
        * Committees (a Committees Folder, which can hold only Committees)
        
        * Specialties (a Specialties Folder, which can hold only Specialties)
        
        Any or all of these default items may be safely deleted as needed.
        
        Working with your directory
        ---------------------------
        
        FacultyStaffDirectory provides content types for creating and organizing details
        of people. It has principally been developed for personnel directories in
        educational institutions but can be repurposed for use in a variety of settings.
        
        The core content type is Person. This has a variety of fields (email, telephone
        number, job title, and so on). You can also easily add your own.
        
        Out of the box, FacultyStaffDirectory offers 3 Classifications that can be
        assigned to Person objects: Faculty, Staff and Graduate Student. If these don't
        work for you, you can add your own Classifications (e.g. Administrators,
        Technicians, Board Members, or whatever you like).
        
        FacultyStaffDirectory also provides several content types for grouping people:
        Departments, Specialties and Committees. If these labels don't make sense in
        your organization, you can easily relabel them. In each case, the association
        between the Person and the grouping (e.g. the Person-Specialty relationship) can
        be given a description. So, for example, if Person Jane Doe is in the Artificial
        Intelligence Specialty, you could give the Jane Doe-Artificial Intelligence
        relationship a description (e.g. "Interested in the cultural impacts of machine
        thinkers").
        
        FacultyStaffDirectory can be configured so people added to the directory
        automatically become Members of your Plone site and each person can edit his or
        her own page. It also adds some new roles, to facilitate management of people.
        For instance, the PersonnelManager role can create new Specialties and assign
        people to them.
        
        Membership integration
        ----------------------
        
        Out of the box, FacultyStaffDirectory offers the following integration with
        Plone users and groups:
        
        The Faculty/Staff Directory itself acts as a group.
          All Person objectscreated in the Faculty/Staff Directory are automatically 
          considered members of this group. This group also provides the option of 
          assigning a global role to all Persons in the Directory. This option should be 
          handled with care. It is generally best to select only the 'Member' role, as 
          this is the most restrictive option.
        
        Departments, Classifications and Committees act as groups.
          Global role assignment is not available for these
          content types, but the groups they define may be granted
          local roles throughout the Plone site.  For complex
          academic units, this can be a great time-saver, since
          personnel management can be tied closely to site
          security management.
        
        Person objects act as users.
          The Faculty/Staff Directory configlet in Site Setup
          allows you to choose whether Person objects provide
          passwords for authentication. If you are using some
          other PAS plugin for authentication, such as PloneLDAP,
          WebServerAuth, PubcookiePAS or CAS4PAS, you will want to
          disable password provision so that authentication will
          cascade to these other systems.
        
        Persons own their own profiles.
          Users defined by Person objects are automatically granted the
          Owner role locally for that object and its contents.  This
          allows users to add to and edit their own biographies, contact
          information, etc.  They also control sharing rights to their
          object and can thus allow assistants to edit content on their
          behalf without sharing their own passwords or user
          preferences.
        
        My Folder action.
          The 'My Folder' action, found on the personal toolbar, is
          altered by the Faculty/Staff Directory product to take users
          defined by Person objects directly to them. Users defined
          through the standard Plone UI will be taken to the usual
          location (portal/Members/<userid>).  Likewise, the personal
          preferences link found in the personal toolbar and on the
          plone_memberprefs_panel or dashboard will take Person users to
          their Person objects.
        
        Restrictions on group membership.
          Owners are not granted the rights to add or remove their
          Person object from Departments, Committees, Classifications
          and Specialties, since these collections are used as
          authorization groups. Instead, this right is reserved for site
          managers and for the newly-created 'Personnel Manager' role,
          installed with the Faculty/Staff Directory product. The
          Personnel Manager is likewise not granted access to the ZMI or
          to personal preferences for Persons. This allows for
          fine-grained separation of management concerns.
        
        Configurable integration.
          Membership integration for Person, Department, Classification
          and Committee objects is configurable.  A switch to turn the    
          function on or off is in the Faculty/Staff Directory
          configuration panel in Site Setup.  It may be necessary to
          disable membership integration for Person objects in systems
          that have established user bases built on LDAP systems, for
          instance.
        
        Configuring the product
        -----------------------
        
        Several global settings, such as phone number and user ID formats, can be
        controlled through the Faculty/Staff Directory configuration panel within Site
        Setup.
        
        Extensibility
        
        Because every organization has a few unique requirements, FacultyStaffDirectory
        supports an extension mechanism based on the archetypes.schemaextender library.
        Using it, you can write plugin products which add fields to or otherwise modify
        our content types. For an example, see the FacultyStaffDirectoryExtender product
        and `its readme`_.
        
        .. _its readme:
           https://weblion.psu.edu/svn/weblion/weblion/Products.FacultyStaffDirectory/tags/3.0/src/Products/FacultyStaffDirectory/examples/FacultyStaffDirectoryExtender/README.txt.
        
        
        Design Rationale & Thoughts
        ===========================
        
        Why the push for just one Directory in a site? Why not just add people to Departments?
          The main thought behind this was that People could be members
          of multiple departments (i.e., faculty member John Smith
          teaches courses in both MSIS and Computer Science). So where
          do we put the Person object?  We'd like to refrain from making
          two Persons if possible, and the alternative of making a
          Department both a container and a referenced object could be
          nightmarish.
        
        Why add membrane?
          We wanted a relatively simple way to let members modify their own
          profiles. With membrane, we get that right out of the box since that
          profile *is* the member. We also get nifty groups like "Faculty" and
          "Chemistry Department" and "Some Useless Committee".
        
        How do I manage People across multiple Plone sites?
          We wish we knew. We suspect it will have something to do with LDAP.
          Suggestions?

        Version History
        ===============
        
        3.1.3 (2012-11-14)
        ------------------
        
        * Added a MANIFEST.in to exclude the examples folder from being packaged with
          the egg to work around the SandboxViolation from EasyInstall when installing
          FSD via buildout on Windows systems.
          [cah190]
        
        * Work around membrane shortcoming which caused group property providers to
          be enumerated as users, raising an error and preventing further user
          enumeration.
          [Laurence Rowe]
        
        
        3.1.2 (2012-04-20)
        ------------------
        
        * Added a 'use site default' option to the available editors list.  Thanks to
          David Carter for reporting this issue and supplying a patch.
          [cah190]
        
        * Require Products.membrane >= 2.1.4 to get the property sheet typing fix which
          affects the ext_editor field.
          [cah190]
        
        
        3.1.1 (2012-03-28)
        ------------------
        
        * Added a sample-content profile. [pumazi]
        
        * fsd_atoz_view and department_textual_view should now work on Department objects
          living outside the FacultyStaffDirectory root on a site.  Warning: external
          Departments will only work reliably for situations where there is a single
          FacultyStaffDirectory object in a site.  If there are multiple
          FacultyStaffDirectory objects, then use of external Departments will have
          undefined behavior.
          [cah190]
        
        * Fixes to author.cpt to support Plone 4.x.  Thanks to Paul Roeland for reporting
          this problem and supplying a patch.
          [cah190]
        
        * Fixed fsd_atoz_view to work with last names having first characters outside the
          A to Z range.  We now allow for any valid unicode character.  Thanks to
          Toni Haka-Risku for reporting this problem and supplying a patch which served
          as a starting point for this fix.
          [cah190]
        
        
        3.1 (2012-03-16)
        ----------------
        
        * Retagging as 3.1.
          [cah190]
        
        
        3.1b1 (2011-08-18)
        ------------------
        
        * Rework templates to reflect the Plone 4.0 layout changes.
          [esteele]
        
        * All FSD content type interfaces now subclass IFacultyStaffDirectoryContent. 
          Q: Why didn't they do so previously?
          A: I have no idea.
          [esteele]
        
        * Drop support for Plone releases below 4.0.
          [esteele]
          
        * Remove the reliance on the documentactions viewlet (not shown by default in 
          Plone 4+). vCard link now appears below the contact information in
          person_view.
          [esteele]
          
          
        3.0.1
        -----
        
        * Add FacultyStaffDirectory to the content types controlled by the FSD Tool's
          activeMembraneStates field. Corrects an issue with customized viewlets 
          failing their permission checks.
          [esteele, pumazi]
        
        * Updated Spanish translation for plone and FacultyStaffDirectory domain
          [macagua (Leonardo J. Caballero G.)]
        
        * Moved the Python import of zope.i18nmessageid to __init__.py and import 
          the MessageFactory for FacultyStaffDirectory domain as FSDMessageFactory
          [macagua (Leonardo J. Caballero G.)]
        
        * Added more support for i18n to "default" profile generic setup.
          [macagua (Leonardo J. Caballero G.)]
        
        3.0
        ---
        
        * Update person.pt in MobilePhoneExtender to be consistent with FSD's person.pt
          (to fix Plone 4 compatibility).
          [cah190]
        
        * Added missing adapter registration to MobilePhoneExtender.
          [cah190]
          
        * activeMembraneStates in the fsdtool now uses a MultiSelectionWidget and the
          workflow states vocabulary.
          [cah190]
          
        * Updated course_view.pt for Plone 4.
          [cah190]
        
        3.0b4
        -----
        
        * No longer support extenderInstallation install methods.  installExtender and
          installExtenderGloballyIfLocallyIsNotSupported will now throw exceptions.
          uninstallExtender will stay around for at least the 3.0 releases to permit
          easy cleanup of old extender installs.
          [cah190]
        
        * Extender developers should use IBrowserLayerAwareExtender to register their
          extender against a browserlayer to make it possible to activate the extender
          per Plone site.  MobilePhoneExtender has been updated as an example.
          [cah190]
        
        * Drop the icon for the vCard action.
          [esteele]
          
        * Slightly rearrange package layout.
          [esteele]
          
        * Stop creating a 'my folder' action. This went away in Plone 3.
          [esteele]
          
        * Stop using deprecated actionicons_tool and put the icon directly on the action.
          [cah190 (Craig Haynal)]
        
        * Register facultystaffdirectory_tool via GS.
          [cah190 (Craig Haynal)]
        
        * Catalog indexes and metadata are now loaded via GS.
          [cah190 (Craig Haynal)]
        
        * Collection/SmartFolder indexes are now loaded via GS.
          [cah190 (Craig Haynal)]
        
        * Register configlet via GenericSetup.
          [esteele]
          
        * Set up navtree properties via GenericSetup.
          [esteele]
          
        * Use an import step and GS profile to set up versioning and diffing,
          respectively.
          [esteele]
          
        * Reinstall/Refresh is not a Plone supported updating mechanism. Use
          portal_setup instead. Removing the code encouraging this sort of thing.
          [esteele]
          
        * Move kupu resource types registration to a GS import step. 
          [esteele]
          
        * Drop the 1.0-2.0 migration script. We'll no longer support a direct 1.0-3.0
          migration.
          [esteele]
        
        * Moved css registry manipulation to GS profile, dropped css and js registry
          install code.
          [cah190 (Craig Haynal)]
          
        * Install dependencies via GS rather than through Install.py
          [cah190 (Craig Haynal)]
            
        * Factory tool registration is now via GS.

        3.0b3
        -----
        * Dropped the plone3 GS profile, paved over the types/\*.xml with versions
          from a working FSD Plone instance.
          [cah190 (Craig Haynal)]
        
        * Don't call Products.Archetypes.Extensions.utils helpers, they seem to make
          Archetypes move itself in the portal_skins lists in a way that breaks
          TinyMCE.
          [cah190 (Craig Haynal)]
        
        * Installer should not be installing ATReferenceBrowserWidget.

          [cah190 (Craig Haynal)]

          which breaks Products.Relations and older versions of Archetypes.
          [cah190 (Craig Haynal)]
        
        * Fixed schema conditions and fsdtool data to prevent authorization failures

          [cah190 (Craig Haynal)]
        
        * Made FSD not installable when creating a Plone 4 site (our GS profiles are not
          sufficient for a functional install).

        3.0b2
        -----

        * Inactive users will now fail to authenticate.
          [cah190 (Craig Haynal)]
        
        * Inactive groups will now appear as empty groups.
          [cah190 (Craig Haynal)]
        
        * Fixed author.cpt to work in Plone 4 by adding missing globals.
          [cah190 (Craig Haynal)]
        
        * Replaced direct page template references to facultystaffdirectory_tool with 
          getToolByName lookups to allow for anonymous viewing of listings.
          [cah190 (Craig Haynal)]
        
        * Added missing icon references to GS type information.
          [cah190 (Craig Haynal)]
        
        * Defined global variables (template_id, normalizeString, member) in skin templates.
          [lvb5153 (Luke Brannon)]
        
        * Removed document_action macros from FSD skin templates.
          [lvb5153 (Luke Brannon)]
        
        * Registered document_actions viewlet to abovecontentbody viewlet manager
          for FSD types (in configure.zcml, since there is no browser package).
          [lvb5153 (Luke Brannon)]
        
        * Replaced object_title global definition with context/Title in FSD
          skin templates.
